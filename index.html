            <p>A programming language is a system of notation for writing computer programs.</p>
            <p> Programming languages are described in terms of their syntax (form) and semantics (meaning), usually
                defined by a formal language. Languages usually provide features such as a type system, variables, and
                mechanisms for error handling. An implementation of a programming language is required in order to
                execute programs, namely an interpreter or a compiler. An interpreter directly executes the source code,
                while a compiler produces an executable program.</p>
                <p>Let's write "Hello world! in Python."</p>
                <code>
                    # This program prints Hello, world!<br>
                    print('Hello, world!')
                </code>

            <p>Some examples of programming languages are: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>C</li>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>Java</li>
                <li>Javascript</li>
                <li>Python</li>
            </ul>
            <p>.. and many more. We will talk about some of them ahead.</p>

            <header>C</header>
            <p>C is a general-purpose programming language.</p>
            <p> It was created in the 1970s by Dennis Ritchie and
                remains very widely used and influential. By design, C's features cleanly reflect the capabilities of
                the targeted CPUs. It has found lasting use in operating systems code (especially in kernels), device
                drivers, and protocol stacks, but its use in application software has been decreasing. C is commonly
                used on computer architectures that range from the largest supercomputers to the smallest
                microcontrollers and embedded systems.

                       return 0;<br>

            <p>C++ is a high-level, general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne
                Stroustrup. </p>
            <p>First released
                in 1985 as an extension of the C programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; as
                of
                1997, C++ has object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level
                memory manipulation for systems like microcomputers or to make operating systems like Linux or Windows.
                It
                is usually implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the
                Free
                Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.</p>
            <p>Let's write hello world in C++.</p>
            <code>#include &lt;iostream &gt;<br> 
                    int main() {<br>
                       // cout displays the string inside quotation<br>
                       std::cout<<"Hello World!";<br>
                       return 0;<br>

            <p>Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few
                implementation dependencies as possible.</p>
            <p> It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let
                programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms
                that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode
                that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The
                syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java
                runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are
                typically not available in traditional compiled languages.</p>
